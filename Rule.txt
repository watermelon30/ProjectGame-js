               Emit energy for line to get bigger
           To Circle:
               Emit energy for circle to get bigger
       To Enemy:

               Collision:
                   Both get shrinked with same amount.
               Energy will shrink the opponent with small amount.
   Line:
       Special mode: Needles emission
           Emit high damage needles to attack other objects.

       To points:
           Consume to get ammo/mass.
           To consume: The head of line touches the points.
       To Teammate:
           To Rectangle:
               Strengthen brick by shooting needles.
           To Circle:
               Can absorb energy(little dots) from Circle.
           To Line:
               Can share ammo by shooting each other.
       To Enemy:
           To Rectangle:
               Collision:
                   Line will get shrinked.
               Line emits needles to attack rectangle with large damage.
           To Circle:
               Collision:
                   Line get shrinked if Circle turn from invisible to visible.
                   Otherwise Circle get shrinked.
               Line emits needles to attack circle with large damage.
           To Line:
               Collision:
                    Both get shrinked with same amount.
               Emits needles to attack each other.
  Rectangle:

       To points:
           Collect points for circle/line to absorb.
       To Teammate:
           To Circle: 
               Absorbing energy from circle.
           To Line:
               Brick getting strengthened if being shot from Line.
           To Rectangle:
               Can pass through any brick made from teammate/itself.

                   Line get shrinked.
               (Bricks and player) get shrinked if shot by Line .
           To rectangle:
               Collision:

Moving Speed: 
    -   The bigger mass the slower.
        Speed for each character with the same amount of mass:
            Line > Circle > Rectangle.

Health amount:
    -   The health amount of a player will start lossing when player is being attacked 
        at the smallest possible mass.
    -   Health amount by each character:
            Rectangle > Circle > Line


Winning condition:
